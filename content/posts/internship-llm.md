# Internship at ZGCWORLD: Building Language Models from the Ground Up

From March to July 2024, I worked as an **Intern Developer at ZGCWORLD**, a fast-moving startup in Beijing focused on developing cutting-edge **large language models (LLMs)** for enterprise use.

## üöÄ Project Overview

During the internship, I contributed to the company‚Äôs in-house LLM training and fine-tuning pipeline. Our team was focused on customizing and scaling transformer-based models for Chinese text understanding and dialogue applications.

### My Key Contributions:

- **Model Architecture Adjustments**  
  Worked with engineers to modify transformer layers and attention mechanisms to improve performance on long documents.

- **Fine-Tuning Pipeline Design**  
  Helped design and debug PyTorch-based fine-tuning pipelines using the `transformers` library from Hugging Face.

- **Data Preprocessing & Augmentation**  
  Handled raw corpus data, cleaned and tokenized billions of tokens using custom tools and libraries.

## üõ† Tools and Technologies Used:

- Programming: Python, Bash, Go
- Frameworks: PyTorch, Transformers (Huggingface), DDP
- Infrastructure: Docker, Linux, Git, large-scale training on GPUs

## üí° What I Learned

This internship gave me a rare hands-on experience with **training models at scale**, where even a minor mistake could lead to hours of wasted GPU time. I also learned how important **infrastructure automation and monitoring** is for real-world machine learning.

_This was one of the most technically challenging and rewarding experiences I‚Äôve had so far._
