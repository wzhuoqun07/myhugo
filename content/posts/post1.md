# Life Between Code and Coffee ☕💻

When people hear you're a computer science student, they often imagine you glued to a screen 24/7, living on energy drinks and debugging cryptic errors. And okay — sometimes that’s accurate. But there’s more to the story.

## ☀️ Mornings Are Sacred

I’m not a morning person by nature, but over time, I’ve grown to appreciate the calm that comes before the day begins. There’s something peaceful about the early light filtering through my window while the kettle boils. My go-to ritual? A cup of pour-over coffee, brewed slowly, no distractions.

Some days I’ll sit by the window, sipping slowly and writing in my notebook — not code, just thoughts. I don’t always have time, but when I do, I remember why I love slow mornings.

## 💻 Life in Code

Most of my weekdays revolve around projects, research, and deadlines. But here’s the thing: I actually love writing code. It’s like solving a puzzle, but the picture keeps changing depending on how clever your approach is.

Right now, I’m working on multimodal AI research — integrating images, DNA, and text. It's exciting, but also full of rabbit holes. Sometimes I spend hours tuning a tokenizer only to realize the issue was a misaligned tensor shape.

Late nights are my most productive time. I dim the lights, put on headphones, queue up some lo-fi beats, and zone in. Those hours fly by. It’s almost meditative — just me, the keyboard, and the hum of the CPU fan.

## 🏙️ Small Adventures in the City

One thing I’ve learned: **you need to leave your screen sometimes**.

Living near Chicago means spontaneous weekend escapes. Whether it’s visiting the Art Institute or wandering around Logan Square with a camera, these trips recharge me. I’ve started collecting little moments — a busker singing in the cold, kids chasing pigeons at the Bean, quiet bookstores that smell like old paper.

I’m no professional photographer, but I take snapshots anyway — not for Instagram, just for memory.

## 🎶 Music and Memory

I have a playlist called “Code & Calm.” It’s a mix of gentle piano, ambient sounds, and a few nostalgic tracks from my high school days. Music has this strange ability to make any moment feel more vivid.

Some tracks I’ve been looping lately:
- “Night Trouble” by Petit Biscuit
- “Snowfall” by Øneheart & Reidenshi
- “In My Head” by Bedroom

I think music is the one constant — no matter how stressful the week is, I always have a soundtrack.

## 🍜 Comfort in Simple Things

There are days when I don't want to think about abstract models or programming logic. On those days, I cook something simple. A bowl of spicy ramen. Fried rice. Or just toast with peanut butter.

Lately I’ve been trying to recreate dishes from home — mapo tofu, tomato-egg stir fry, congee with pickled veggies. Cooking grounds me. It reminds me that I’m more than just a student or a developer.

## 💭 Reflections

I used to think being busy meant being productive. But I’m learning that **stillness matters too** — the unstructured time when you let your mind breathe.

Not every hour needs to be optimized. Some hours are just meant to be lived.

To anyone reading this who’s in the same whirlwind of school, work, and ambition: I hope you find time for slow coffee, night walks, quiet playlists, and silly moments. They don’t show up on a resume, but they make the rest of life worth it.
